# Book Search Engine

## Description

This is a book search engine that allows users to search for books by title, author, or subject. The search results are displayed in a list, and the user can click on a book to view more details about it.

This application was a fully functional Google Books API search engine with a RESTful API. It was then refactored to use GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The application was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

The application is deployed to Heroku with a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

## Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- To run the application in development mode, run `npm run develop`.

## Video Demonstration

This is a demonstration of the application using `npm` to run the application in development mode. Heroku deployment was not possible due to errors. Still trying to troubleshoot.
